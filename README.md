This script is written in python.  It is used to automate the renewal of library books through the library systems mobile page. 

How to use it:  
You must add your username and password to the script (as a string).  The intended way this is to be used is through a server or computer running the script everyday to check which books are due that day, or are already due, and renewing them.  There may be an error when the renew all button is present.  

Things to add:  An email when notification when the last renew was used, double checking that a renew was succesful
